            <h2> <u>The Importance of Forests </u></h2>
            <p>Forests are among the most vital ecosystems on our planet, covering approximately 31% of the
                Earth's land area. They are not just collections of trees; they are
                complex habitats teeming with life and essential for sustaining
                ecological balance. Forests play a crucial role in supporting
                biodiversity, regulating the climate, conserving water, and
                providing economic and cultural benefits.Forests are home to
                more than 80% of terrestrial biodiversity. They provide habitats
                for countless species, including mammals, birds, insects, and
                plants. This rich biodiversity is essential for the health of
                ecosystems. Different species interact in ways that support
                processes like pollination, seed dispersal, and nutrient
                cycling. The loss of forests leads to habitat destruction,
                threatening species with extinction and disrupting ecological
                balance. Conserving forests is therefore critical for maintaining biodiversity.One of the most
                significant functions of forests is their role in
                climate regulation. Trees absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) during photosynthesis, storing carbon in their
                biomass and releasing oxygen.
                It is estimated that forests absorb around 2.6 billion tons of CO2 annually, which helps mitigate
                climate change. Additionally, forests
                influence local weather patterns, affecting humidity and temperature. By acting as natural air
                conditioners, forests help maintain a stable climate, making their preservation vital in the fight
                against global warming.
